{"id": 460217, "title": "Integrating Prediction and Attribution to Classify News", "summary": "Recent modeling developments have created tradeoffs between attribution-based models, models that rely on causal relationships, and \"pure prediction models\" such as neural networks. While forecasters have historically favored one technology or the other based on comfort or loyalty to a particular paradigm, in domains with many observations and predictors such as textual analysis, the tradeoffs between attribution and prediction have become too large to ignore. We document these tradeoffs in the context of relabeling 27 million Thomson Reuters news articles published between 1996 and 2021 as debt-related or non-debt related. Articles in our dataset were labeled by journalists at the time of publication, but these labels may be inconsistent as labeling standards and the relation between text and label has changed over time. We propose a method for identifying and correcting inconsistent labeling that combines attribution and pure prediction methods and is applicable to any domain with human-labeled data. Implementing our proposed labeling solution returns a debt-related news dataset with 54% more observations than if the original journalist labels had been used and 31% more observation than if our solution had been implemented using attribution-based methods only.", "status": "New", "classification": "Federal", "filing_type": "Single", "in_federal_register": false, "federal_register_number": null, "regalytics_alert_id": "3087FED170wsWS20220701", "proposed_comments_due_date": null, "original_publication_date": "2022-07-01", "federal_register_publication_date": null, "rule_effective_date": null, "latest_update": "2022-07-01", "alert_type": "Report", "agencies": ["Federal Reserve System"], "pdf_url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/integrating-prediction-and-attribution-to-classify-news.htm", "created_at": "2022-07-05T05:45:34.088790-04:00", "states": {"United States": []}}

Today, new Canadians will take the Oath of Citizenship at an in-person ceremony for the first time in 2 years, and they will be joined virtually by candidates from across the country. A livestream of the event from the Queen\u2019s Marque in Halifax will be available, as we welcome 49 newcomers to the Canadian family. One of our greatest strengths as a country is our diversity. Newcomers fuel our economy by bringing essential skills in key sectors, help advance our recovery from the pandemic by starting new businesses and support those in need by volunteering in their own communities. More than ever, they are helping build a more diverse, inclusive and prosperous Canada.\u201d", "status": "New", "classification": "Federal", "filing_type": "Single", "in_federal_register": false, "federal_register_number": null, "regalytics_alert_id": "24794CAD422975333NADA DAY11820220701", "proposed_comments_due_date": null, "original_publication_date": "2022-07-01", "federal_register_publication_date": null, "rule_effective_date": null, "latest_update": "2022-07-01", "alert_type": "Press Release", "agencies": ["Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada"], "pdf_url": "https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2022/06/statement-by-minister-fraser-on-canada-day.html", "created_at": "2022-07-05T05:45:56.982090-04:00", "states": {"Canada": []}}

And if Rhode Islanders are planning a day at state beaches, the Department of Environmental Management (DEM) is urging them to buy their passes online today to avoid getting stuck in annoying traffic tie-ups at beach entrances this weekend. Historically, Independence Day week is the peak of the beach season and depending on the weather, tens of thousands of residents and out-of-state visitors may flock to the eight state surf beaches. Prepaid customers may use the express lanes at beaches for speedier access. Purchasing season or daily flex passes online also will help DEM keep the express lanes open, as there have been past instances when the express lanes could not be used because too many people were paying for parking at the entry gates rather using pre-paid parking passes. Express lanes are available at all state beaches except for Salty Brine, Charlestown Breachway, and East Beach, which are one-lane facilities. DEM's parking vendor employs license plate recognition (LPR) technology at the express lanes whereby a scan is taken of the rear license plates of prepaid customers confirming that the customer has paid to allow for quick entry. DEM continues to accept applications for seasonal positions including qualified lifeguards for state beach facilities. Positions are still available at many locations throughout the state. All lifeguard positions require certification and special training in first aid, CPR, and senior lifesaving. Swimming accidents and drownings can occur when lifeguards are present. As always, DEM urges parents and guardians to watch their children while they're swimming or near the water.

In response to a request from Congress, the Office of Research on Women's Health of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) evaluated research on the health of women currently underway related to 1) rising rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, 2) rising rates of chronic debilitating conditions in women, and 3) stagnant cervical cancer survival rates. Input on the three priority areas was obtained from experts in women's health, members of the public, and federal stakeholders. Across the life course, significant gaps in evidence regarding conditions, disorders, and diseases that occur in women were illustrated. Fundamental basic and translational knowledge gaps in many female-specific conditions and diseases with sex-specific presentations, symptoms, or responses to treatments have hampered the generation of robust scientific data needed to provide high-quality, evidence-based care to women. Key opportunities identified to improve the health of women include enhanced implementation of existing best practices and interventions to reduce disparities. Undertaking intentional clinical research on the health of women will produce significant returns on investment and has the potential to greatly improve human health. Improving the health of women requires centering research around the needs of women, implementation of best practices, and interventions to reduce disparities.", "status": "New", "classification": "Federal", "filing_type": "Single", "in_federal_register": false, "federal_register_number": null, "regalytics_alert_id": "26018NCATS130115PE20220701", "proposed_comments_due_date": null, "original_publication_date": "2022-07-01", "federal_register_publication_date": null, "rule_effective_date": null, "latest_update": "2022-07-01", "alert_type": "Press Release", "agencies": ["U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"], "pdf_url": "https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2022/07000/Perspectives_From_Advancing_National_Institutes_of.4.aspx", "created_at": "2022-07-05T05:46:13.917311-04:00", "states": {"United States": []}}

CYP3A7 expression has also been observed in a subset of the adult population, including pregnant women, as well as in various cancer patients. The characterization of CYP3A7 is not as extensive as other CYPs, and health authorities have yet to provide guidance towards DDI assessment. To identify potential CYP3A7-specific molecules, we used a P450-Glo CYP3A7 enzyme assay to screen a library of 5,000 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs and drug-like molecules, and compared these screening data with that from a P450-Glo CYP3A4 assay. Additionally, a subset of 1,000 randomly selected compounds were tested in a metabolic stability assay. By combining the data from the qHTS P450-Glo and metabolic stability assays, we identified several chemical features important for CYP3A7 selectivity. Halometasone was chosen for further evaluation as a potential CYP3A7-selective inhibitor using molecular docking. From the metabolic stability assay, we identified twenty-two CYP3A7-selective substrates over CYP3A4 in super some setting. Our data shows that CYP3A7 has ligand promiscuity, much like CYP3A4. Furthermore, we have established a large, high-quality dataset that can be used in predictive modeling for future drug metabolism and interaction studies.", "status": "New", "classification": "Federal", "filing_type": "Single", "in_federal_register": false, "federal_register_number": null, "regalytics_alert_id": "26018NCATS11467ID20220701", "proposed_comments_due_date": null, "original_publication_date": "2022-07-01", "federal_register_publication_date": null, "rule_effective_date": null, "latest_update": "2022-07-01", "alert_type": "Press Release", "agencies": ["U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"], "pdf_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.899536/full", "created_at": "2022-07-05T05:46:14.241027-04:00", "states": {"United States": []}}

Attracting well-qualified people to the profession is important, and fears of facing liability for someone else\u2019s missteps can dissuade excellent candidates from seeking compliance jobs. Accordingly, I have spoken in the past of the importance of thinking carefully about when to impose liability against a CCO. I have underscored that the compliance obligation belongs to the firm, not to the CCO. Reminding firms that compliance is their responsibility helps to ensure that they dedicate adequate resources to, and appropriately defer to the judgment of, their compliance departments.\u201d", "status": "New", "classification": "Federal", "filing_type": "Single", "in_federal_register": false, "federal_register_number": null, "regalytics_alert_id": "3089SEC1F8CC40620220701", "proposed_comments_due_date": null, "original_publication_date": "2022-07-01", "federal_register_publication_date": null, "rule_effective_date": null, "latest_update": "2022-07-01", "alert_type": "Statement", "agencies": ["Securities and Exchange Commission"], "pdf_url": "https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-hamilton-investment-counsel-070122", "created_at": "2022-07-05T05:46:32.150457-04:00", "states": {"United States": []}}

The horse was on site for an event at the Colorado Horse Park from June 22 until June 25, 2022 before returning to its home in Weld County. Two days after returning home, the horse began displaying neurologic signs consistent with Equine Herpes Myeloencephalopathy, a disease caused by EHV-1 virus. CSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory completed the initial diagnostics which were inconclusive. Follow-up diagnostics showed a low viral load of EHV-1 on one nasal swab. Two whole blood samples, as well as one CSF sample, were negative for EHV. The horse remains hospitalized at CSU VTH with continued supportive therapy. Because the horse was removed from the premises prior to the onset of clinical signs, the risk of exposure to horses at the horse park is low.

In spite of everything, homebuyers with nominal-rate loans are paying negative real interest for the first time in 40 years. The pandemic wreaked havoc on a large number of businesses, but decisive action by the Central Bank and the Government has provided a cushion against the blow, and now companies in general are well positioned \u2013 with the caveat that many tourism companies have yet to right themselves. It is also very important that Iceland's external position be well-balanced. Our net external asset position is positive: we own more than we owe abroad. This means that foreign interest rate hikes will not erode our balance of payments. The exchange rate of the Icelandic kr\u00f3na is also close to equilibrium, and the financial system is no longer dependent on external financing as it once was.

And to stress the important role that you can play in working collaboratively across the public and private sectors to deliver real improvements to the cost, speed, transparency and accessibility of cross-border payments. Cross-border payments are essential to the global economy. It is estimated that this year the global cross-border payment market will settle $156 trillion. And it is not just the wholesale markets that are impacted: cross-border payments are crucial to businesses, consumers and remittances. In Greece alone remittances reached an all-time high of 338 EUR million in January 2022. And the importance of cross-border payments is due to grow further. Business-to-business cross-border payments grew over 25% over the past two years and reached $34 trillion in 2021. But despite their importance, many cross-border payments are still slow, expensive and difficult to track. While some wholesale payments are very effective, there are too many cases, for remittance payments in particular, where payments can take up to 10 days and cost more than 10% of the value of the underlying transfer. And this has a very real impact on businesses and individuals.\u201d", "status": "New", "classification": "Federal", "filing_type": "Single", "in_federal_register": false, "federal_register_number": null, "regalytics_alert_id": "17613BISR220629H20220701", "proposed_comments_due_date": null, "original_publication_date": "2022-07-01", "federal_register_publication_date": null, "rule_effective_date": null, "latest_update": "2022-07-01", "alert_type": "Speech", "agencies": ["Bank for International Settlements"], "pdf_url": "http://www.bis.org/review/r220629h.htm", "created_at": "2022-07-05T05:45:21.494988-04:00", "states": {"Switzerland": []}}

After this semi-philosophical opening, I want to switch and discuss the active aspect of recent technological changes: the payments market, crypto, smart contracts, virtual currencies, and CBDC.

These steps even helped us to endure the COVID-19 crisis better, as they allowed a rapid and efficient switch to contactless payment, and they will continue to help in developing the economy even long after the crisis.

Incentives arise from the positive response of investors to returns achieved through cyclical risk-taking and non-linearities in the relationship between fund returns and fund flows, which may keep managers from fully internalising the effects of adverse outcomes on their portfolios.
